    <td>Today I learnt by following the steps in the instructions and then applying my expanding knowledge of python to solve the questions. I think that this strategy worked for me because I got much more done than I had got done in the weeks previously. I think that overall this is the best strategy that I have used so far.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by at the start of the lesson spending a lot of time on one exercise which did not have to take long and which other people could have solved in minutes because I was distracted at the beginning of the lesson. I need to make sure that I only focus on the work so that I get more of it done</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will focus more at the beginning of the lesson because that is when most of the work should be started instead of just sitting there doing nothing as that is just useless. I will improve my learning next time by focusing at the start of the lesson as that is the most important part of the lesson.</td>
