    <td>We learnt how to finish the apple question and I learnt how to use a usb stick when we were learning. I found that when we were coding we noticed on exercise 3 that the coding was easier than we had thought because before we thought that it was harder than it was.</td>

    <td>We argued a bit today so we may have not done as well as we could have if we had not argued and I think that I need to be more organised next time because we were less organised than before.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I should not argue with Lawrence because it made us slower and we did not work as well as a team as usual which next time will make our work more efficient. We also made a lot of mistakes whilst writing the first code such as having plurals of words, the computer was not very happy with that so next time make sure we read the code whilst typing.
