Lesson 2

Hello everyone,

Today we continued our spreadsheet, we did not have a lesson last week due to a school photo.

 This week we started the lesson by talking about the left tool and the discounts as well as talking about applying our knowledge that we learnt last lesson. 

We made discount codes and then we used the start of the first two letters to make a discount percentage which was made in a table, 

we also did the delivery cost which change depending on the subtotal 

and then I added the VAT. Next week my target is to make sure that I add a table that only makes certain codes valid and makes sure the codes are real.
