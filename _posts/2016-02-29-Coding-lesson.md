Coding lesson  

Today we played a game called codecombat where you had fun scenarios which you had to code your way through.

The codes looked like this

self.attack("Gurt") gurt is the name of one of the monsters. 

self.move up()

I had a character called tharin and he was equipped with lots armor I even got to open a door with a secret password. I had a lot of fun and I definitely will play it outside of school.
