  <tr>
    <td>I learnt how to code an awesome number sequence going up and down and then I made a code which made a red circle on the screen it was absolutely awesome and we managed to follow the image instructions as I hoped to last week as they were hard to interpret but this week they were much better than before as the images were from above and we quickly went over the light exercise as we struggled a bit with them last week but this week we did it a lot more quickly and it was much better.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by getting distracted because Brendan didn't have a partner so I helped him as well and that made us work slower because I was doing two things at once.
I need to make sure that our group's code is accurate because our red dot exercise was hard to code and we had to redo it many times.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that I am not juggling between two partners as it means that I am not as focused when I am learning so I learn less. I am also going o make sure that I copy the code properly as I get annoyed when I can't do something properly. I will improve my learning by what I said in the paragraph before as by having two partners and not doing the code as accurately as I can do it I lost time.</td>
