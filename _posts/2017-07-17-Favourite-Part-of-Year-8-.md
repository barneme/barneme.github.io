Favourite Part of Year 8

So much has happened this year. My programming has improved immensely. I think that I am now capable of understanding basic python. But anyway what was my favourite part of year 8. Over this year my website has developed greatly. I particularly enjoyed customizing my website and I am pleased with the results. It looks nice doesn't it?

I found making the website most enjoyable because I got to independently develop my website. I got to choose the colour scheme and wallpaper which i found exciting as beforehand my background was just a single colour. I think it was most exciting because I got the most freedom doing it and I have taken pride in making my website the best it can be.

At the start of the year my blog was boring and all of it was in two colours but now my blog is a lot more vibrant and interesting. My blog has developed a lot in this past year and I hope that in the future it will get even better.
