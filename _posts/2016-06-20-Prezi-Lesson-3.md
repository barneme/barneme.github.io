Prezi Lesson 3

Today we looked at some examples of our Prezis after the holiday. The first one that was shown was my one, Mr Keen said it was good but I needed to look through it more. Then we looked at another one which Mr Keen said had bad zooming and after that we looked at one from another class where someone had copy and pasted because it was a much better quality than the rest of his work.
