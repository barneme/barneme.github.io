  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by reading the instructions thoroughly and then I did exactly as it said to do and it worked. I found that it was the best method because otherwise I would just be guessing and I would have no clue what to do. This strategy was most effective when I read it through a couple times because on the first read of it I did not understand every feature of it. I also learnt parts of the python code language and it encouraged things such as boolean logic.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by not putting in enough spaces so that some parts of the code did not work and that means that I would have to stay on the same exercise and solve it which means if I had put the right spaces I would have got further. I had the same problem with spelling because when I typed I made quite a few spelling errors that I had to correct. But that does not just slow me down a lot on codecademy it even slowed me down whilst I was writing this because I had to correct a lot of words.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to make sure that I check my spelling because that held me back a bit to what I could fully do. I will make sure that I improve my learning by checking that a word is spelt correctly after I have written it. This will help because it means that I will not have to keep going back through my work to correct my code and I will have more time to code new things.</td>
