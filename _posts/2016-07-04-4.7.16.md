4.7.16

Today we had a talk about last week's homework ,what the consequences were and how you would feel if it had happened to you and we thought that we would feel depressed and even suicidal and then at the end we got our microbits I was really excited and last of all we were shown how to put our games on it.

For homework we have to do our blog post and work on our game.
