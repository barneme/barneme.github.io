Prezi

This week we watched a video about prezi and then we started making our own presentations. I made mine on the earth and i tested out each font.

I had lots of points that I hid in places we would not normally think to look one was bigger than the earth.

For homework we had to experiment with prezi I spent a lot of time exploring and pressing things.
