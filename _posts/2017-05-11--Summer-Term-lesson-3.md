  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by reading the instructions thoroughly and then I did exactly as it said to do however if that did not work then I used trial and error until I found the answer. Then I repeated that for each question. But the reason I did not reach my goal was because the lesson had longer and harder exercises. However overall I find my strategy effective as the other strategies I have used in the past do not work as well as it.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by not spelling words correctly meaning that some parts of the code did not work and that means that I would have to continue the exercise until I corrected it if I had put the right letters in then I would have got further. I had the same problem with capital letters because when I typed I made quite a few words that need capital letters without them so that it says I have errors that I had to correct. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I need to make sure I spell words correctly and add the correct capital letters as that could be one of the main reason as to why I have not reached my goal this week. I will improve my learning by making sure I read all of my work properly and then submit it instead of wasting time.
