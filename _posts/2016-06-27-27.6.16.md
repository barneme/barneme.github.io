27.6.16

Today we were put in a different room and we talked about safety online but first we started out by what is social media used for and our group came up with entertainment and then we got asked a different question what are we afraid of on the internet some of them were brainwashing(radicalisation and grooming),being stalked, blackmailing and hacking. Our homework was to look up articles on sexting and revenge porn
