20th November 2017

Today was our last spreadsheet lesson as this year we only have  8 week terms for the IT and drama. We did not learn any new code because this lesson we finished our spreadsheets and we tried translating our friend's code.

Today I changed the colour scheme as it was purple before but now it is red yellow and white. I added an extra table to my code so that my vlookup would translate back from code afterwards. It now has a full cycle from normal words to ciphertext back to normal code again. 

After I had done that I added a new sheet and added Finn's language of code in tables similar to when I started the code and had to make my code language. After I had created the table I made a named range. I then went back to the main sheet (sheet 2) and added the tables of translation like at the beginning. Then he gave me some code which I had to translate back into English and it translated to break. Below is what the code looked like.
