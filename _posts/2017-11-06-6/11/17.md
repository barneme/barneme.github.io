Today we started the lesson by talking about cryptography which we had to look up. It turned out that cryptography is the study of writing and decoding codes. It was first notably used by Julius Caesar because he did not trust that his messengers would safely deliver the messages so he made a code which only his allies understood.

The type of cryptography that we used today was Caesar's code where the code is moved one letter on from the letter that it is meant to be. For example A would be B and C would be D. So card would be DBSE.

We then made our own code and my code was enemy ahead which became FOFNZ BIFBE.

I layed it out to look like this.
