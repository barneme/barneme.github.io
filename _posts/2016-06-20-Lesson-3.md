Assignment:

How can your current or future social media activity affect your goals and aspirations for the future or how you want to be when you are older?

You can focus your response on things you have posted (if you use social media) that you might reconsider posting or deleting in the future. You can also focus on ways you have used or would like to use social media in positive ways that can help you with your future education, hobby, or career goals.

You could say something you didn't mean to say such as when you are tired you might post something saying "I hate my Boss"  and then your boss might see it and sac you.

You could have a hobby where you go to a gym week and you could post something rude about it.

You could complement your company so much and advertise that you may get promoted.

You could help a friend who missed a lesson by telling them what happened so you would be helping their education and they could do the same.

You could send your friends who missed a lesson the notes you took to help them understand what you did in the lesson
