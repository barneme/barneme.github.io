Today we added to our spreadsheets as it was our last lesson before half time and before our blogs were going to be marked. I refined my discount and my delivery charges as well as colouring in some tables. But most importantly I had added the rest of my costs and my salaries so that by the end of my lesson I had managed to make my spreadsheet show if my company had losses or gains and my company had had a gain.

The costs were all added together including the salaries to help work out if my company had losses or gains. Due to the large amount of product sold my company had a gain which you can see in the first table.

I also got rid of some code that had just been left as #VALUE as it was just failed code from the past that was no longer needed as the solution for the problem it was trying to solve as it had already been solved.
