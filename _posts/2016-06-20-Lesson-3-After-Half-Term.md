Lesson 3 After Half Term

Today we first we looked through classroom and we discussed what we can improve with our game plan and our blog some people in class did not get their blogs working. We then went on to Github and we looked for code that said red carpet and pygment. Then people had to refork Barry Clark's work I did not have to do it because my github is still working, if it wasnâ€™t then I would not be able to post on my website. Our blog post is not supposed to be what we did the lesson. It is supposed to be about the fabric of what we did. Today we did code 3 I found a certain part difficult this went well and next lesson I will make sure to learn more about the difficult part that is a good example of what we are supposed to do. If my blog stops working I need to make sure I change the config.yahml. I will also have to delete this repositry
