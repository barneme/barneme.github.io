Today in IT we continued with the spreadsheets from last time, in the lesson we talked about solving code problems as they may look complex but they can be simplified which led us to then talking about the iserror code which we added to our spreadsheet. It took multiple attempts for me as I had multiple errors such as extra spaces and commas but my most important error was I forgot to add if at the beginning which was preventing my code from functioning properly.

After I added to my translations so that it translated properly into the code language meaning that it didn't just add the first letters to boxes that I wanted to have in it.
