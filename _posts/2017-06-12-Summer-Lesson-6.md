    <td>I learnt by reading the instructions and by using trial and error to work out the answer. I found that like weeks previously this was the best tactic for me as otherwise I would not get anything correct and I would just be sitting there and waiting for the answer to appear on the screen.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning in the lesson by talking too much. I need to make sure that I talk less next lesson because I only got a few exercises done and then I spent the rest of the lesson stuck on one because I was not fully focusing on it. So next week I will make sure that I do not talk as much.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will talk less as I distracted myself in the lesson by talking too much to my neighbour. This will improve my learning because it means that I will focus more and my work meaning that in the lesson I will not spend the time talking I will spend the time in the lesson on the work.</td>
