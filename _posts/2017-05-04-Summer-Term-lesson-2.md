  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by trial and error after reading the instructions and if I got stuck I didn't give up and just continued untill I got there. There was a lot of strings this week and they all started like this: len(my_string). I also had to do the date and time and it got the real date and time! How cool is that?  After that there were some questions with boolean logic and they were all maths questions. I found that the trial and error strategy was more effective than what I normally do.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by talking a bit too much and I feel that that held me back a bit from what I could have potentially done. I need to make sure that next week I put all my concentration and my work and make sure that I get as much as I can done.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will make sure that next time I concentrate on my work more and get more done in the lesson. I will improve my learning by doing that next lesson as this lesson I made only a tiny bit more progress than last week and I want to do more than that.</td>
