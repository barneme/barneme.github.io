IT Lesson 3

Today we carried on with the spreadsheets. Today I added the codes that were valid and if you put in a code which is invalid then it says 0 whilst if it is a real code then it says yes and soon it will say how much percentage there is of discount.  We also added if(iserror (cell number) ,0, which means that if you delete the code for the object instead of the entire row saying #N#A because it is confused due to the code not telling it what to do if nothing is there is nothing. I also put my code into action so that when I made a table on a different page it understood if the code was real and does what I wrote above if it works so that it means you get the discount instead of just putting in a code.

At the start of the lesson we also talked about our homework which was to make sure that our spreadsheets were working and to put in proper VAT, subtotals and grand totals so that we had an idea of how much money it was all together.
