    <td>I learnt by reading the instructions and then doing what they said as best as I could however that strategy does not always work as sometimes like this week there was an exercise which did not work straight after I had read the instructions and that exercise ended taking up the majority of the lesson so for that exercise I used trial and error to work it out by trying lots of different codes.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by spending most of my time stuck on one exercise. I need to make sure that I analyse the instructions correctly so that I get the correct answer faster as it took far too long this week on an exercise with a simple a simple answer which could have taken 5 minutes if I had done it properly.</td>

    <td>Next time I will use a different keyboard as again the W mostly did not work however occasionally when I accidentally press a key it got stuck meaning I had to waste time deleting all the surplus W's which could have been time spent coding which I find annoying and a waste of time.</td>
