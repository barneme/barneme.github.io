  <tr>
    <td>I learnt this lesson by trial and error like the last few lessons. The reason why it works for me is because once I have read the instructions and I try the first time I usually fail so trial and error is the best tactic for me because otherwise like most people I would just give up like that. I also learnt by reading the instructions more than once.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by spending too much time  on one question and I was talking too much in the lesson. The question I got stuck on was very hard even after I got the hints I still had no idea how to solve it but finally at the near end of the lesson I solved it and it felt rather obvious after I had done it.

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that I talk less as that is one of the main reasons why I did not get as much work done as previously but it was not the only reason why as like the weeks before my spelling and capital letters were not great and also as I said before the questions were harder this week. So next week I will make sure I pay more concentration to my work so I get it done faster.
