Hello everyone, 

Today we had the first IT lesson of the year and we learnt how to use spreadsheets and we leant lots of code for spreadsheet such as =E4+E4*$B$5 which would times the first number by the percentage i had in colum b row 5 and the dollar signs would make sure that when i dragged the formula down it would stay as b5 but would change e4 to the next letter and whatever the answer is would depend on what is in the next box (f4) and this would change every time that you move the formula down a box.

We also learnt how to make tables on spreadsheet which was very easy and the you filled them in by clicking on the box and you can colour a box by highlighting the part that you want to colour. The format is similar to docs in some ways but is very different in others. For example if you type = a menu comes up giving you commands you can type, such as SUM which would add two numbers together if you select two boxes with numbers in them. This does not work for words and if you select a box with words you will not get an answer instead you will get a message in that box saying error and if you click on the error it will tell you that there is a fault in your code.
