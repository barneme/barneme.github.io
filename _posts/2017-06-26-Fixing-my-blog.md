    <td>I learnt by going through my file and corrected from there. I found that the strategy that worked for me the most was looking through my past css file to see if I could find the error and by using that tactic it worked and it turned out to be a very simple solution on one of my lines I had a missing ; which stopped my entire blog from working. I had another problem where my website looked like a google doc I fixed that by copy and pasting my old code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by at the start of the lesson not looking for what was wrong with my blog I just continued editing it making it worse and adding more errors which lead to me spending the entire lesson fixing my blog as well as fixing it at lunch as well. I need to work on checking if my blog is working  whilst I am going so I do not have a whole bunch of errors.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson I will make sure that I check that my blog is working as I go so that I am not left with a massive chunk errors that take far longer to fix than they did to make. This will improve my learning by ensuring that my blog works and that my post will be uploaded proving that I have written them.</td>
