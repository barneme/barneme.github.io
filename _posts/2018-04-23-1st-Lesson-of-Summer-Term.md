1st Lesson of Summer Term

Today we started new python project which was to make a buzzfeed like quiz that has multiple choice questions which in the end will give you an answer based on the choices that you have selected. This is then done by labeling the choices 1 to 3 and once that has been done over a period of questions then you add the numbers that they put together to give them an overall score which will give the result. We did this with the following code.

 #Collect variable data

print("Answer the following questions and we'll tell you what potato snack you are")

ref1=0

while ref1==0:

  V1 = input("1 - Balanced; 2- Unhealthy from all those chips; 3 - Only eat greens")

  V2 = input("")

  V3 = input("")

  V4 = input("")

You then at the end of the code write a series of responses based on their overall mark.
