Monday 9th October Year 9

Today we commenced the lesson by talking to our partners about costs of a business. The costs me and my partner came up with are shown in the table below which I have copied from my spreadsheet as well as noting what they are for in the table.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Costs </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wages - Paying the workers their salaries.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Utilities - Water, Electricity and Gas which are not free!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tax - All businesses have to pay tax</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Supplies -  It is very important that your company has the correct equipment needed for the product.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rent - Buildings do not magically appear so you have to pay for the use of factories and buildings that your business works in.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Advertisement - Advertising a company is very important and a lot of money is spent on this to catch the eyes of potential clients.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Insurance - It is extremely important that you ensure your company helping cover you for things such as machinery.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Packaging and postage - If the company is shipping abroad or posting to people, you will need to pay for your company's postage as well as packaging to avoid damage of items that are being posted.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Licences - For some companies you need an insurance to create their products, this goes for gun and explosive manufactures.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Travel and subsistence - If you have meetings overseas or if you need to use lorries to post products you will need to pay for these.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


We had a discussion afterwards with the rest of the class about this and I added some of the above to the list such as travel and subsistence and licences. 

Afterwards we carried on editing our spreadsheets and then I added a proper grand total by converting some of the sum into minus numbers so that it worked properly.

Once I had done that we were called to the front and we were showed how to add spreadsheets to our blogs which by the time you are reading this will be below here.
