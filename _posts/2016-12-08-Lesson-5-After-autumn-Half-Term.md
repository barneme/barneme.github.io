    <td>Today we finished the book! The last piece of code we did was really long and it took a very long time it was even on two boxes in the book instead of the normal one. We found swapping round between each other at different parts of the code was best as it meant that we did not get slower when we got bored of writing the code as it was very repetitive.
After we did that we went on to experiment with the robot as others had and we thought it would be a good idea to practise our coding skills. I learnt a lot of different code in the lesson and what it means example: Armshoulder (0) will stop the shoulder part of the robot arm from moving. We even programmed the robot arm to pick up a pen!</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by not doing as much freestyle coding as my partner. As I had done the majority of the code for the last exercise Lawrence did some freestyle coding and there was not enough time for me to do as much. One thing I think that I could improve on is efficiency as I am a very slow typer as this paragraph alone took around 5 minutes to type and for most of you, you could type this in less than 3 minutes.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that i try and type faster and that I get more time freestyle coding ( If I have time which I might not as we might get a new task) which will help me understand the code's meaning which is important for the future as it will help me be able to code better than currently even though I did learn a lot of code today this will my improve my learning by helping me learn more code than I currently know.</td>
