Today we looked at propaganda. First we discussed where you can find it and we then looked on the internet for news which has propaganda in it like the image below

The news tell you to believe their side even though some of them including the image above is not true.

We then looked at a video which showed different types of advertising. One of the types was emotional adverts which are often charity adverts where they seem really sad.

Our homework is to find an article involving propaganda, today, on Thursday and in the weekend. 

Here is a link to the first article
