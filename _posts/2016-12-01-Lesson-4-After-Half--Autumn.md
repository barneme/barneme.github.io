  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by reading through the instructions before we started so that we could understand what to do and I was really excited because I had always wanted to make a robot arm move as you see all over the internet and it was the first time that I had ever coded a robot although once I had done it I found one thing slightly concerning, that it liked to click when it reached the end and it made me feel slightly uneasy as I felt like it might spark even though I knew it wouldn't. I found that collaboration was the most effective method as we took the coding in turns.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by spending a long time setting up and because of this we lost quite a lot of time and that was very annoying as I feel I could have achieved more than I did in the end as I could of fitted around 5 or 10 minutes extra work in and we would have been on the next exercise by then. So I need to make sure that I don’t waste time on things that are useless as I do not learn anything.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that I don’t waste time and get on with the work at the beginning because even though I was excited I did waste a lot of time doing absolutely nothing at the start which I will never do again as what do I gain from it? Absolutely nothing! I will improve my learning by learning to understand what the code means instead of just what it says in the book.</td>
