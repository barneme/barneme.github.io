    <td>I learnt that I could be a lot faster than I thought I would be because we managed to redo the first exercise and we managed to finish the boys and girls class exercise as well. We found that working together was very important because we did more than we thought we could.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by making mistakes in the code so we had to take a while to fix the code because we were not sure what bits of the code were wrong. Next time I think we need to read the instructions carefully like we did last week</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time we need to remember to save our work because we had lost some of it because when we went to the Graphics room we had forgot to save it. So next time i will improve it by saving our work and remembering to bring a usb stick.</td>
