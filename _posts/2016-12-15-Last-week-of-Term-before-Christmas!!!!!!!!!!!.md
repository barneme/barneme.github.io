  <tr>
    <td>I learnt how to move the about around the level I found that trying lots of different techniques and I even won a level by chance as I had accidentally added a lightbulb but that made the level a lot quicker as I had been on it for quite a while. I also learnt how to use proc one and proc two as extra code when I had run out of space in the main coding box and it turned out very useful as I used it alot.</td>

    <td>I spent a lot of time on level 2-6 as it was very hard but in the end the solution was as follows.
https://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.wikimg.net%2Fstrategywiki%2Fimages%2Fthumb%2F8%2F80%2FLBFlash2-6.png%2F915px-LBFlash2-6.png&imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fstrategywiki.org%2Fwiki%2FLightbot%2FFlash_Procedures&docid=4vfxAmtvrc3UVM&tbnid=D4YdlEx4YSI-SM%3A&vet=1&w=915&h=611&bih=655&biw=1366&q=light%20bot%202-6&ved=0ahUKEwiD8LGd4PbQAhVGWhoKHYYnAMcQMwgbKAAwAA&iact=mrc&uact=8
It seems simple right? But at the time I did not get it and everytime I moved it unlit a square so unlike the answer above I added three lightbulbs randomly in the top box as I was out of ideas as I was on it for around 20 minutes but luckily my guess let me win. I need work on remembering what worked before, before changing it again.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that I do not spend so much time on one thing that took most people under 5 minutes. That will improve my learning majorly and therefore I will get much more of the harder stuff done in the lesson which I didn't manage to do today and I didnâ€™t get on the second website because of that but I was on the last level of the last stage. To anyone reading this before Christmas I wish you a very Merry Christmas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</td>
