Raspberry Pi lesson 1

**Today when we used Raspberry Pi, Lawrence and I did the first task called Hello world. We managed to do the first part after following the instruction then I added another tab to change the colour and then I opened another to carry on but our exit button was not working so we carried on we and changed the colour of the page twice and then lesson ended**

**What went well. We used all the correct code**

**Next time work a bit faster than we did today**
