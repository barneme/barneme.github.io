Lesson 2 After Half Term

Today we started by doing an anonymous survey. Then we started to make our games and for mine I started making mine, half way through the lesson I accidentally deleted  it so I started to redo mine then I decided to change mine from a maze into pong since we had already done something similar for homework. This is my code so far: /* When the BBC micro:bit runs    */

function onStart(  ) {

	microbit.say("Level 1 (easy)");

	microbit.draw(Pattern("00000.10001.10101.10001.00000"));

	globals.posX = 0;

	globals.posY = 4;
