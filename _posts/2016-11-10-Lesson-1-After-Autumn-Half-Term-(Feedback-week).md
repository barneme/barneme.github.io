  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by looking at other people's blogs that I needed to make sure my colour scheme worked, that I put enough effort into my homework and to make sure that I have features such as a table. From my feedback and how I felt about my blog I have changed certain features of my blog which I was not fond of, such as the fact that my image was absolutely massive.It was the size of a tennis ball instead of a more sensible size like this I also wanted to make all my titles onto the left side of my page as well as making my tables larger.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited by learning by having errors in my code which I did not know how to fix such as the size of my image which was way bigger than it needed to be. I need to remember to check through my code when I write it so it does not cause problems later on such as my sccs file breaking completely which would my website look extremely boring it would have no colour at all which would make it look like wikipedia page.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will remember to check through my code also because my image caused a problem earlier which I managed to fix but the image was still big. I need to also make sure I don't add code that does not needed to be added such as code to align text to the middle as it just made my website look weird as it also affected my paragraphs and it made it look like I added an extra empty line between each line. I will improve my learning overall by reading through my code thinking if I need to add it or will my website look worse.</td>
