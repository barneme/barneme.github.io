Lesson 5

Today we learnt about reality vs fantasy. We watched an advert that was a mixture, it was a pepsi advert where a chimpanzee was driving a taxi and it claimed that pepsi max had no sugar but it has sweeteners which are far worse for you. Next we played a game where we either agreed with the statement or disagreed, if we agreed we would go on one side of the classroom and for disagreed the other. The statements were things like do you think reality tv is always reality.

Next we watched the opening scene of a reality show called the biggest loser. Which showed some of the features of a reality tv show. Next we watched a video showing how mcdonald's made a photoshoot and a comparison to the real one and they look quite different.
