    <td>I learnt that there were many different things that you can change on your website for instance you can get an image as your background and you can even make around the titles on the blog page a box with circular corners and shadows how cool is that! We changed our websites by adding colour schemes to make them look better.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by not remembering my password to github so it took me a while to login so that I could start my work. I need to remember to not be forgetful as it means I am not able to get as much work done in the lesson than I could have if I had remembered my password!</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make more complex things on my website because this week I changed the colour of the background and fonts as well as a few other things such as adding tables so that the posts will look better. I will improve my learning by doing more research so I can add things more quickly to my website.</td>
