    <td>We managed to get our lights to light up at the very end of the lesson because it took a long time to change our code from what it was at the start of the code to the other code on the next page. We learnt from that that we can make complex wiring as copied from the diagrams which were very hard to copy as they were taken from an angle! I think that the strategies we used the most were reading through the book whilst we were going so we could make the changes that it said in the text as well as the normal code boxes. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>We worked a bit slowly as the image was hard to copy a it was taken from an angle so it made it quite annoying to copy if you can't see the entire circuit board properly. I need to make sure also that I don’t get too aggravated as in the lesson I got very annoyed by the amount of time it took us to copy the diagrams of the circuits because of that problem with the images of the circuit board not being from above.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will make sure that next lesson we study the image of the wires in the circuit board before we start so we don’t have to do it as many times as we did today because we did it too many times and got quite annoying near the end but we finally did it at the end of the lesson. By doing so I will improve my learning by being able to get more done in the lessons and that will mean that there will be more I can write about in my blog as well.
