    <td>Today i finished a few sections and I finally finished an exercise which i had been struck on for a very long time. I found that reading the hints really helped make the exercises less challenging. That strategy helped me to work more efficiently and made it easier to solve the exercises. I also changed the background of my website again and this time i changed it properly meaning that it was faster.</td>

    <td>My blog took ages to upload the pictures for the wallpaper it took half an hour. Which I find very annoying because when the image finally uploaded it did not work with my colour scheme and I had to choose a different image again so that it worked. I need to plan my time more efficiently because although I did get a lot of work done I did spend a lot of time just refreshing my page to get the new image.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will be more patient and do other tasks instead of waiting for a long time to complete one simple task which does not take long at all. I will improve my learning by doing that as it will lead to me getting more work done in the lesson and which would also mean that I learn more code.</td>
