    <td>Today I learnt by doing exactly what the instructions said to do and this strategy was effective because it meant that I went up 5%. This is good because I haven't  gone up that much for a while as I have recently been finding the exercises more challenging. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by doing lots of typos because I spent a lot of my time correcting mistakes even in this blog I have spent a while correcting my mistakes as it is a habit of mine to make mistakes and this limited my learning because it wasted part of my time.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will check my writing more carefully because it meant that time that I could have spent on other exercises was spent looking through my work checking to see if I had made grammar mistakes which I did a lot. By checking through my work for mistakes before I submit, it means that I will save time overall and it means that i will get more code completed</td>
