    <td>I learnt the basics of raspberry pi and I learnt a lot because it was my first time using the program.
I found that the strategies that were most effective were 
1. Reading the instructions at the beginning of the lesson so we did not have to read the whole thing while working.
2. Working as a team which was my target because it is always much easier to work as a team than arguing throughout the lesson</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by not working as fast as I would have hoped I would have.
I think that I need to work on being more efficient when I work so I will be able to perform to the best of my abilities. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I should work faster because we were changing the page colour at the end of the lesson next time it would be better if I could do it faster and also I need to familiarise myself more with the way raspberry pi works.
I will improve my learning by getting more done each lesson. </td>
