Lesson 1 After Summer Half Term

 

Today we started planning for our microbit game and at first I decided that I would make a game where you had to pop bubbles but at the end of the lesson I decided that that would not be a good idea. Then I decided to do pong and here is my plan 

Title:Pong Number of Players: 1Aim: 3 levels of difficulty hard, easy and medium you have to hit the ball to the other side you get power ups by hitting the cherry. You also lose if you don't get the cherry on the hard level. You score 10 toInputs: Use the mouse move or arrow keys to move and keyboard to type your name.What process will the game calculate:The time left, which maze to use and the score.Output: Where the ball goes and where the rackets go How to lose: By missing the ball three times you lose and the words pop up on the screen. If and when you lose you start again
